`starts` date indicates the begining of the operation of the pricing
`ends` date indicates the end of life of the pricing.

In this case, your pricing is not operational as the ending date
(`ends`) of the pricing is before the starting date (`starts`),
i. e. your pricing will not ever be operational.
